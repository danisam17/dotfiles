cd ~/.dotfiles && ./go-time
```

### Some notes

Most commits here are vim-related, though I change my shell around every once in a while when I'm Feeling Lucky™. `vup` will install all vim plugins using Vundle. 

There shouldn't be anything particularly private or sensitive in here – most things I keep in `.whatever` files that should be .gitignored in projects/globally. 

If you do come across something, I'd appreciate an email - I'll tip you back some beer money via Dogecoin if something like that goes down. <3 

### Miscellaneous

Whatever license is the most free here, that's the one I'm picking. This is all scrapped together from other people and most of the time I have no idea what I'm doing, so fork and do whatever with no consequence. I don't know man, it's just some config files.
